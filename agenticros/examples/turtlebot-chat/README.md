# TurtleBot3 Chat Control Demo

Control a TurtleBot3 in Gazebo simulation using natural language through WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, or Slack.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- An OpenClaw instance with a messaging channel configured

## Quick Start

1. Start the simulation stack:
   ```bash
   cd docker
   docker compose up
   ```

2. Install the AgenticROS plugin in your OpenClaw instance:
   ```
   Configure the plugin with rosbridge URL: ws://localhost:9090
   ```

3. Send a message to your robot through any configured messaging app:
   - "Move forward 1 meter"
   - "Turn left 90 degrees"
   - "What's the battery level?"
   - "Take a photo"

## Demo Commands

| "Navigate to (3, 2)" | Sends Nav2 goal |
| "What do you see?" | Captures camera frame |
| "Check the battery" | Reads `/battery_state` |
| `/estop` | Emergency stop |
